# SEEDLabs

The labs were designed by Wenliang Du of Syracuse University, and retrieved from SEEDlabs website  
https://seedsecuritylabs.org

This started as lab work for Advanced Security Testing (CYBR627) at Bellevue University, and now is just for personal practice. 

There are two versions of the labs found here: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/labs.html
